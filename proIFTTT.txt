Install IFTTT app in your smartphone.
Login in to IFTTT.
Click on add applets.
You will get two options - IF and then that
In IF search for google assistant and click on it, add your own phrases like switch on red.
In "then that" search for adafruit IO, connect your adafruit IO to it. Choose the feed name you had given to the feed. Then in data type 16.
Click okay when done.
Try it now, open google assistant. Say the phrase you had put before, lights should go red.
In data i have used 16 because, each numbers in the remote have a specific data like - 1 = 16, 2 = 17, 3 = 18, 4 = 20.....
Try your own combinations! Enjoy coding :)
